# books_beauty_ai

● For this project, I built a full-stack web app that generates creative makeup look recommendations based on the aesthetic and 
themes of book descriptions 


● To get the book descriptions, I integrated the Google Books API to retrieve book metadata and descriptions from user search queries 


● To generate makeup looks based on the retrieved book descriptions, I used OpenRouterʼs OpenAI-compatible endpoint to generate AI-powered makeup looks with custom prompt 
engineering 


● I also designed a responsive React.js frontend for users to search for books and view personalized recommendations
